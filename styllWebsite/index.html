                the app is a solution to a problem we all face. how many times
                have you come across a great pair of pants while browsing
                instagram or pinterest, but couldn't find them anywhere? you
                click on the photos, read the comments, ask around, and still
                nothing. with styll, such a situation will no longer occur.
                every post must have at least three tagged items - top, bottom,
                and accessories. you can view everything in a separate section,
                where users can also share alternative clothing options.
              </div>
              <div>
                furthermore, the app offers several other exciting features!
                first and foremost, you can rate each outfit on a scale of 1 to
                10 using a slider. you know those yt or tiktok series where
                outfits are being rated? well, now you can find all of that in
                the app. i’m also developing a section called ‘selection.' it
                will feature daily curated outfits with tagged items. in the
                same section, you'll find ‘essentials' so that everything is
                within reach. you can save all the things you see in the app in
                your ‘wishlist.' it's a public feature on every profile, so
                questions like ‘what do you have on your wishlist?' will no
                longer be necessary. lastly, you can save your favorite outfits
                in the ‘inspo' tab, which is also public.
              </div>
              <div>
                currently, the app is in its very early stages of development,
                but the prospects are promising! in the near future, i plan to
                introduce a kind of outfit challenge within the app. later on, i
                hope to add, among other things, AI that will suggest
                alternatives for specific clothing items. i also intend to focus
                on video content, particularly GRWM related.
              </div>
              <div>
                i strongly encourage you to download the app! i value your
                feedback and suggestions to know which direction to take. if you
                have any objections or concerns about the app idea, feel free to
                express them candidly.
